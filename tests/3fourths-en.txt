The Wankel engine has the advantages of compact design and low weight over the more common internal combustion engine, which uses reciprocating pistons. These rotary engine applications give advantages in a variety of vehicles and devices, including automobiles, motorcycles, racing cars, aircraft, go-karts, jet skis, snowmobiles, chainsaws, and auxiliary power units. Certain Wankel engines have a power-to-weight ratio over one horsepower per pound.[2] Most engines of the design are of spark ignition, with compression ignition engines having been built only in research projects.


The central drive shaft, called the "eccentric shaft" or "E-shaft", passes through the center of the rotor being supported by fixed bearings.[6] The rotors ride on eccentrics (analogous to crankpins in piston engines) integral to the eccentric shaft (analogous to a crankshaft). The rotors both rotate around the eccentrics and make orbital revolutions around the eccentric shaft. Seals at the apices of the rotor seal against the periphery of the housing, dividing it into three moving combustion chambers.[4] The rotation of each rotor on its own axis is caused and controlled by a pair of synchronizing gears[6] A fixed gear mounted on one side of the rotor housing engages a ring gear attached to the rotor and ensures the rotor moves exactly one-third turn for each turn of the eccentric shaft. The power output of the engine is not transmitted through the synchronizing gears.[6] The rotor moves in its rotating motion guided by the gears and the eccentric shaft, not being guided by the external chamber; the rotor must not rub against the external engine housing. The force of expanded gas pressure on the rotor exerts pressure to the center of the eccentric part of the output shaft.

The easiest way to visualize the action of the engine in the animation is to look not at the rotor itself, but the cavity created between it and the housing. The Wankel engine is actually a variable-volume progressing-cavity system. Thus, the three cavities per housing all repeat the same cycle. Points A and B on the rotor and E-shaft turn at different speedsâ€”point B circles three times as often as point A does, so that one full orbit of the rotor equates to three turns of the E-shaft.
