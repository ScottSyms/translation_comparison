Before you start

Are you a resident of Canada?

You become a resident of Canada for income tax purposes when you
establish significant residential ties in Canada. You usually establish
these ties on the date you arrive in Canada.

What are residential ties?

Residential ties in Canada include:

-   a home in Canada
-   a spouse or common-law partner (see the definitions in the Federal
    Income Tax and Benefit Guide) or dependants who move to Canada to
    live with you
-   personal property, such as a car or furniture
-   social ties in Canada

Other residential ties that may be relevant to determine your residency
status include, but are not limited to, a Canadian driver's licence,
Canadian bank accounts or credit cards, and health insurance with a
Canadian province or territory.

Newcomers to Canada who have established residential ties with Canada
may be:

-   protected persons (including refugees) within the meaning of
    the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
-   individuals who have applied for or received permanent resident
    status from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada
-   individuals who have received "approval-in-principle" from
    Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to stay in Canada

If you were a resident of Canada in a previous year, and you are now a
non-resident, you will be considered a resident of Canada for income tax
purposes when you move back to Canada and re-establish your residential
ties.

Do you need help determining your residency status?

If you are not sure if you are a resident of Canada for income tax
purposes, complete Form NR74, Determination of Residency Status
(Entering Canada). Send your form to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) as
soon as possible to receive an opinion on your residency status before
your return is due.

For more information about residency status, see Income Tax Folio
S5-F1-C1, Determining an Individual's Residence Status.

Canada's tax system

Canada’s tax system is similar to that of many countries. Employers and
other payers usually deduct taxes from the income they pay you whereas
individuals with business or rental income usually pay their taxes by
instalment.

Many of the benefits people enjoy in Canada are made possible through
taxes. Canada's tax system pays for roads, schools, health care, social
security, and public safety.

Each year, you determine your tax obligation by completing an Income Tax
and Benefit Return and sending it to the CRA. On the return, you report
your income and claim your deductions, calculate your federal and
provincial or territorial tax, and determine if you have a balance of
tax owing for the year, or a refund of some or all of the tax that was
deducted from your income during the year. For more information, see Do
you have to file a tax return?

Under Canada's tax system, you have the right and responsibility to
determine your income tax status and make sure you pay your required
amount of tax each year according to the law.

Guide RC17, Taxpayer Bill of Rights Guide: Understanding your rights as
a taxpayer, outlines the fair treatment you are entitled to receive when
you deal with the CRA. For more information, go to Taxpayer Bill of
Rights. You have other rights under Canadian laws including the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

Compliance

Each year, the CRA promotes compliance and taxpayer education
through review programs.

The CRA reviews deductions and credits on the Income Tax and Benefit
Return and ensures that income amounts have been correctly reported. The
CRA also reviews benefits and credits such as the Canada child benefit
(CCB) and the goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST)
credit.

Keep all receipts and documents for at least six years after you file
your return. If the CRA chooses to review your return, you will have to
provide your receipts to support your claims.

The underground economy

The underground economy is defined as income earned but not reported for
income tax purposes and the sale of goods or services on which taxes or
duties have not been paid. The underground economy is often associated
with the exchange of goods and services for cash where no records are
kept.

The CRA works to maintain the confidence of Canadians in the fairness
and honesty of Canada’s tax system. As part of its efforts to fight the
underground economy, the CRA works with the provinces and territories,
private sector, and other countries and regions to encourage compliance
with Canada’s tax laws and ensure that those who do not comply have no
unfair advantage over honest taxpayers.

The CRA has developed a balanced approach to fighting the underground
economy. This approach includes:

-   activities such as audits which ensure that income and expenses are
    properly reported. An audit may lead to a reassessment of tax, and
    the imposition of penalty and interest
-   an educational strategy to increase awareness of the risks and
    consequences of participating in the underground economy

Note

A criminal investigation and prosecution may result if tax evasion is
suspected; this could lead to fines and imprisonment.

If you do not have permission to work in Canada because you cannot get a
temporary social insurance number or work permit, you are working
illegally in Canada.

Social insurance number

As a newcomer to Canada, you will need a social insurance number (SIN).
The SIN is a nine-digit identification number that is unique, personal,
and confidential.

The CRA uses your SIN to identify you for income tax and benefit
purposes. You have to give your SIN to anyone who prepares tax
information slips (such as a T4 slip) for you.

If Service Canada gave you a temporary SIN (starting with the number 9)
or if the CRA gave you a temporary tax number (TTN) or an individual tax
number (ITN), and you decide to become a permanent resident of Canada,
you have to apply for a SIN with Service Canada. Once this new SIN has
been assigned to you, do not use any other SIN, TTN, or ITN that was
previously assigned to you.

For general information about the SIN and learn how to apply, go to
Social Insurance Number. To find the address of the Service Canada
centre nearest you, go to Find a Service Canada Office or call
1-800-622-6232.

Goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax credit

The goods and services tax (GST) is a tax that you pay on most goods and
services sold or provided in Canada. In some provinces, the GST has been
blended with provincial sales tax and is called the harmonized sales tax
(HST).

The GST/HST credit helps individuals and families with low and modest
incomes offset all or part of the GST or HST that they pay.

The CRA will determine the amount of your credit based on your adjusted
family net income and the number of children you have. This information
is also used to calculate any credits from related provincial and
territorial programs.

If you become a resident of Canada in the year, you may be entitled to
the GST/HST credit after your arrival. For more information, see
Form RC151, GST/HST Credit Application for Individuals who Become
Residents of Canada. Use this form only if you do not have children. If
you have children under 19 years of age, use Form RC66, Canada Child
Benefits Application, instead.

To continue receiving the GST/HST credit, including any related
provincial or territorial payments, you have to file a return each year
even if you did not receive any income in the year.

If you have a spouse or common-law partner, only one of you can receive
the GST/HST credit. The credit will be paid to the person whose return
is assessed first. No matter who receives the credit, the amount will be
the same.

Payments are issued in July and October 2022, and in January and
April 2023. For more information, see GST/HST credit.

Canada child benefit and child disability benefit

If you are responsible for the care and upbringing of a child who lives
with you and is under 18 years of age, you may be eligible for the
Canada child benefit (CCB) and any benefits for certain related
provincial or territorial programs for that child.

The CRA determines the amount of your benefits based on the following:

-   the number of eligible children you have and their ages
-   your province or territory of residence
-   your adjusted family net income
-   your child's eligibility for the disability tax credit

You and your spouse or common-law partner (if applicable) must both file
your own Income Tax and Benefit Return each year, even if you did not
receive any income in the year, so that the CRA can calculate the amount
of benefits you are entitled to.

To apply for the CCB and benefits for certain related provincial or
territorial programs, complete Form RC66, Canada Child Benefits
Application. Depending on your immigration and residency status, you may
also have to complete Schedule RC66SCH, Status in Canada and Income
Information for the Canada Child Benefits Application. Send your
Form RC66 to the CRA, along with any required schedules and
documentation as soon as possible after you and your child arrive in
Canada.

In addition to the CCB, you can also receive a child disability benefit
if your child is eligible for the disability tax credit and the CRA
approved Form T2201, Disability Tax Credit Certificate, for that
child. You can get these forms at Forms and Publications or by calling
1-800-387-1193.

Property you owned before you arrived in Canada

If you owned certain properties (other than taxable Canadian properties)
at the time that you immigrated to Canada, the CRA considers you to have
sold the properties and to have immediately reacquired them at a cost
equal to their fair market value (FMV) on the date you became a resident
of Canada. This is a deemed disposition.

Your property could include items such as shares, jewelry, paintings or
a collection.

Usually, the FMV is the highest dollar value you can get for your
property in a normal business transaction.

You should keep a record of the FMV of your properties on the date you
arrived in Canada. The FMV will be your cost when you calculate your
gain or loss from disposing of the property in the future.

You dispose of your property when, for example:

-   You sell it
-   You give it
-   It is destroyed or stolen

For more information, see Guide T4037, Capital Gains.

Unwinding a deemed disposition for returning residents

If you ceased to be a resident of Canada after October 1, 1996, and you
later re-establish Canadian residency for income tax purposes, you can
elect to make an adjustment to the deemed dispositions that you reported
when you emigrated from Canada. The CRA refers to this as an election to
“unwind” a previous deemed disposition.

You can make this election to unwind if you still own some or all of the
property that was deemed disposed of when you emigrated. If you make
this election for taxable Canadian property, you can reduce the gain
reported on your tax return for the year you emigrated by an amount you
specify, up to the amount of the gain you reported.

If you make this election for property other than taxable Canadian
property, you can reduce the amount of the proceeds of disposition that
you reported on your tax return for the year you emigrated by the least
of:

-   the amount of the gain reported on your tax return for the year you
    emigrated
-   the fair market value (FMV) of the property on the date you returned
    to Canada
-   any other amount to a maximum of the lesser of the above-noted
    amounts

Note

The definition of taxable Canadian property changed on March 5, 2010. As
a result, property that was considered taxable Canadian property when
you became a non-resident may no longer be considered taxable Canadian
property when you return to Canada. If this is the case, special rules
may apply. For more information, go to Individuals – Leaving or entering
Canada and non-residents or contact the CRA.

The election to unwind may result in the reduction or elimination of the
tax owing for the gain from the previously reported deemed disposition
of property on emigration. If you make this election, and you had
previously elected to defer payment of the tax owing on the income from
the deemed disposition, some or all of the security you may have
provided may be returned to you.

You can make this election by sending your request in writing on or
before your filing due date for the year you re-establish Canadian
residency for income tax purposes to the address indicated at Where to
mail your documents. You must also include a list of the properties you
own and the FMV of each property this election applies to.

Previously deferred tax

When you immigrate to Canada, you are generally considered to have
disposed of, and to have immediately reacquired, most properties that
you own on the date you immigrate. If you had previously elected to
defer payment of the tax owing on the gain from the deemed disposition
of property other than taxable Canadian property on emigration, you may
now have to pay the deferred tax. For more information, contact the CRA.

Do you have to file a tax return?

Even if you lived in Canada for only part of the year, you may have to
file an Income Tax and Benefit Return. 

File a return for 2021 if you:

-   have to pay tax for the year
-   want to claim a refund
-   want to get benefit and credit payments

To continue getting the benefits and credits you may be eligible for,
you need to do your taxes each year, even if you had no income. The CRA
uses the information from your return to calculate the goods and
services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credit, the Canada child
benefit (CCB), and any related provincial or territorial amounts. For
more information, see Do you have to file a return?

If you lived in Quebec on December 31, 2021, you may have to file a
separate provincial tax return. For more information, visit Revenu
Québec or call 1-800-267-6299.

If you have a modest income, a simple tax situation, and require
assistance filing your return, you may be eligible to get free tax help
from the Community Volunteer Income Tax Program (CVITP). For more
information, go to Free tax clinics.

If you are self-employed or own a small business and need help
understanding your tax obligations, you can get free in-person tax help
from the Canada Revenue Agency's Liaison Officer Service.

Which tax package should you use?

Use the income tax package for the province or territory where you
resided on December 31, 2021. Tax rates and tax credits are different
for each province and territory so it is important to use the correct
tax package.

You can get a tax package at Forms and publications or by contacting the
CRA.

Ways to file your return 

EFILE

This is a secure CRA service that lets authorized service providers,
including discounters, complete and file your return electronically. For
more information, go to EFILE for individuals.

NETFILE

Use the CRA’s secure service to complete and file your return
electronically using certified tax preparation software or a web tax
application. Go to NETFILE for a list of software and applications,
including some that are free.

By mail

If you are mailing your return, send it to the address indicated in
Where to mail your documents. Do not mail your return to any other
address. 

Return due date 

Generally, your 2021 return must be filed on or before April 30, 2022.

When a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday
recognized by the CRA, your return is considered on time if the CRA
receives it or if it is postmarked on the next business day. For more
information, go to Due dates and payment dates.

Self-employed persons

If you or your spouse or common-law partner carried on a business in
2021 (other than a business whose expenditures are primarily in
connection with a tax shelter), your tax return for 2021 must be filed
on or before June 15, 2022. However, if you have a balance owing for
2021, you still have to pay on or before April 30, 2022.

Deceased persons

If you are the legal representative (executor, administrator, or
liquidator) of the estate of a person who died in 2021, you may have to
file a return for 2021 for that person.

When there are no legal documents designating a legal representative,
you may request to be the deceased person's representative by completing
an Affidavit form for intestate situations. For more information about
your filing requirements and options, and to know what documents are
required, see Guide T4011, Preparing Returns for Deceased Persons, and
Information Sheet RC4111, Canada Revenue Agency – What to Do Following a
Death.

Penalties and interest 

If you owe tax and do not file your return by the due date, the CRA will
charge you a late-filing penalty and interest on any unpaid amount
owing. For more information, see Due dates and Penalties and Interest.

Completing your return 

You will find most of the information you need to complete your 2021
Income Tax and Benefit Return in your income tax package. However, in
the following section, you will find other useful information to help
you complete your return.

Identification and other information

The CRA needs your identification and other information to assess your
tax return and calculate your goods and services tax/harmonized sales
tax (GST/HST) credit, plus any benefits you may be entitled to under the
Canada child benefit (CCB).

Residence information 

Enter the date that you became a resident of Canada for income tax
purposes.

Example

Harinder arrived in Canada and established significant residential ties
on June 8, 2021. Harinder will enter their date of entry as "0608" on
their return. 

[]

If you requested a social insurance number (SIN) but have not yet
received it, and the deadline for filing your return is near, file your
return without a SIN to avoid a possible late-filing penalty and any
interest charges. Attach a note to your return to let the CRA know why
you did not enter your SIN.

Note

You will not be able to file online without a SIN.

Your spouse's or common-law partner's information

Their SIN

Enter your spouse’s or common-law partner’s SIN if they have one.
Otherwise leave it blank.

Net income from line 23600 of their return to claim certain credits (even if the amount is “0”)

Enter your spouse’s or common-law partner’s net world income for 2021
regardless of their residency status. Net world income is the net income
from all sources inside and outside Canada.

In the space under this line, enter your spouse’s or common-law
partner’s net world income for the period that you were a resident of
Canada.

If your marital status changes and you are entitled to receive the CCB,
GST/HST credit, or Canada Workers Benefit (CWB) advance payments, you
must tell the CRA by the end of the month following the month when your
status changes. However, in the case of separation, do not notify the
CRA until you have been separated for at least 90 days. Let the CRA know
by calling 1-800-387-1193, or by sending a completed Form RC65, Marital
Status Change.

Income

You have to report your world income for the part of the year that you
were considered a resident of Canada. World income is income from all
sources inside and outside Canada. In some cases, pension income from
outside Canada may be exempt from tax in Canada due to a tax treaty, but
you must still report the income on your return. You can deduct the
exempt part on line 25600 of your return.

However, for the part of the year that you were not a resident
of Canada, you have to report the following amounts:

-   income from employment in Canada or from a business carried on in
    Canada
-   taxable capital gains from disposing of taxable Canadian property
-   taxable part of scholarships, bursaries, fellowships, and research
    grants you received from Canadian sources

Note

For the part of the year that you were not a resident of Canada, do not
include on your return any gain or loss from disposing of taxable
Canadian property, or loss from a business carried on in Canada, if the
gain from that disposition or any income from that business would be
exempt from tax in Canada under a tax treaty. For more information about
the disposition of taxable Canadian property, see Guide T4058,
Non-Residents and Income Tax.

If you are a protected person (including a refugee) and you received
funds from a charitable organization such as a church group or from an
individual, you generally do not have to report the amounts on your tax
return. However, if a charitable organization hired you as an employee,
the employment income you received is taxable.

Deductions

You may be able to reduce your income by claiming deductions that you
qualify for. The following deductions are some of the most common.

Registered retirement savings plan contributions

Generally, you cannot deduct contributions that you made to a registered
retirement savings plan (RRSP) in 2021 if this is the first year that
you will be filing a return in Canada.

If you filed a return in Canada for any tax year from 1990 to 2020, you
may be able to claim a deduction for RRSP contributions that you made in
Canada for 2021. The CRA determines the maximum amount you can deduct
based on certain types of income you earned in previous years.

You can view your RRSP deduction limit online on My Account for
Individuals or on the MyCRA mobile app.

For more information, see Guide T4040, RRSPs and Other Registered Plans
for Retirement.

Pension income splitting

If you and your spouse or common-law partner were residents of Canada on
December 31, 2021, you can elect to split pension income that qualifies
for the pension income amount (line 31400 of your return). To make this
election, you and your spouse or common-law partner must complete and
attach Form T1032, Joint Election to Split Pension Income, to your
returns.

Moving expenses

Generally, you cannot deduct moving expenses incurred to move to Canada.
However, if you entered Canada to attend courses as a student in
full-time attendance enrolled in a program at a post-secondary level at
a university, college, or other educational institution, and you
received a taxable Canadian scholarship, bursary, fellowship, or
research grant to attend that educational institution, you may be
eligible to deduct your moving expenses.

You cannot deduct moving expenses if your only income at the new
location is scholarship, fellowship, or bursary income that is entirely
exempt from tax.

For more information, see Form T1-M, Moving Expenses Deduction.

Support payments

If you make spousal or child support payments, you may be able to deduct
the amounts you paid, even if your former spouse or common-law partner
does not live in Canada. For more information, see Guide P102, Support
Payments.

Treaty-exempt income

Once you become a resident of Canada, you have to report your world
income. World income is income from all sources inside and outside
Canada. However, all or part of the income may be exempt from Canadian
tax. This may be the case if Canada has a tax treaty with the country or
region where you earned the income and there is a provision in the
treaty preventing Canada from taxing the type of income you received.
You can deduct the exempt part on line 25600 of your return.

For a list of countries and regions that Canada has a tax treaty
with, see Tax treaties. If you are not sure if the applicable tax treaty
contains a provision that makes your income from sources outside Canada
exempt from tax in Canada, contact the CRA.

Other deductions

You may be able to claim other deductions. For more information, see
the tax package for the province or territory where you resided on
December 31, 2021.

Federal tax and credits

Complete Step 5 of your return to calculate your federal tax and any
federal credits that apply to you.

Federal non-refundable tax credits

These credits reduce your federal tax owing. However, if the total of
these credits is more than your federal tax owing, you will not get a
refund for the difference.

As a newcomer to Canada in 2021, you may be limited in the amount that
you can claim for certain federal non-refundable tax credits for 2021.

To determine the total amount you can claim, add the amounts for each
federal non-refundable tax credit that applies to the part of the year
that you were:

-   a non-resident of Canada
-   a resident of Canada

The total amount you can claim for each federal non-refundable tax
credit cannot be more than the amount you could have claimed if you were
a resident of Canada for the whole year.

Part of the year that you were not a resident of Canada

You can claim the following federal non-refundable tax credits (if
applicable to you) if you are reporting Canadian-source income (as
listed under Income) for the part of the year that you were not a
resident of Canada:

-   Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan contributions
-   social security arrangement contributions (see Form RC269, Employee
    Contributions to a Foreign Pension Plan or Social Security
    Arrangement – Non-United States Plans or Arrangements)
-   employment insurance premiums
-   disability amount for self
-   disability amount transferred from a dependant
-   interest paid on loans for post-secondary education made to you
    under the Canada Student Loans Act, Canada Student Financial
    Assistance Act, or similar provincial or territorial government laws
-   your tuition fees
-   donations and gifts

In addition, you can claim the remaining federal non-refundable tax
credits in full if the Canadian-source income you are reporting for the
part of the year that you were not a resident of Canada is 90% or more
of your net world income for that part of the year.

The total amount that you can claim for each tax credit cannot be more
than the amount you could have claimed if you were a resident of Canada
for the whole year.

See the tax package for the province or territory where you resided on
December 31, 2021 for the remaining federal non-refundable tax credits.

Notes

If you are claiming full federal non-refundable tax credits, attach a
note to your return stating your net world income (in Canadian dollars)
for the part of the year that you were not a resident of Canada. Show
the net income you received from sources inside and outside Canada for
that part of the year separately. The CRA cannot allow the full amount
of these federal credits without this note.

If you are filing your return electronically, provide your income and
follow the instructions for claiming these credits using NETFILE
certified software or provide it to your EFILE service provider. 

Part of the year that you were a resident of Canada

You can claim the following federal non-refundable tax credits (if
applicable to you) for the part of the year that you were a resident
of Canada:

-   Canada Pension Plan or Quebec Pension Plan contributions
-   social security arrangement contributions (see Form RC269, Employee
    Contributions to a Foreign Pension Plan or Social Security
    Arrangement – Non-United States Plans or Arrangements)
-   employment insurance premiums
-   provincial parental insurance plan premiums
-   volunteer firefighters' amount
-   search and rescue volunteers' amount
-   Canada employment amount
-   home accessibility expenses
-   home buyers' amount
-   adoption expenses
-   digital news subscription tax credit (DNSTC)
-   pension income amount
-   interest paid on loans for post-secondary education made to you
    under the Canada Student Loans Act, Canada Student Financial
    Assistance Act, or similar provincial or territorial government laws
-   your tuition fees
-   medical expenses
-   donations and gifts

In addition, you can claim the other remaining federal non-refundable
tax credits (if applicable to you) based on the number of days you were
a resident of Canada in the year.

Use the date that you arrived in Canada, entered in the “Residence
information” area on page 1 of your return, to calculate the number of
days you were a resident of Canada. 

Example 1 – line 30000 of the return

David arrived in Canada on May 6, 2021. David's net income between May 6
and December 31 was $50,000.

David claims a basic personal amount of $9,079.23 calculated as follows:

(240 days in Canada ÷ 365 days in 2021) × $13,808 = $9,079.23

David claims $9,079.23 on line 30000 of his return.

Example 2 – line 30100 of the return

Jennifer is 70 years old. Jennifer arrived in Canada on March 31, 2021.
Jennifer's net income between March 31 and December 31, 2021, was
$30,000. Jennifer can claim an age amount calculated as follows:

1.  Prorate the maximum age amount of $7,713.
    (276 days in Canada ÷ 365 days in 2021) × $7,713 =         $5,832.30
    (A)
2.  Prorate the base income amount of $38,893.
    (276 days in Canada ÷ 365 days in 2021) × $38,893 =    $29,409.50
    (B)

Since Jennifer's net income is more than amount B, she must reduce
amount A by 15% of the amount of her income that is more than the
prorated base income amount (amount B), as follows:

$30,000 – $29,409.50 =  $590.50 (excess amount)
$590.50 × 15 % = $88.58 (C)

The age amount that Jennifer can claim is amount A minus amount C:

$5,832.30 – $88.58 = $5,743.72

Jennifer claims $5,743.72 on line 30100 of her return.

Example 3 – line 30300 of the return

Suzanne and her spouse Richard arrived in Canada permanently on
September 23, 2021. Suzanne's net income between September 23 and
December 31 was $100,000, and Richard's net income was $800 for the same
period. Suzanne can claim a spouse or common-law partner amount
calculated as follows:

1.  Prorate the maximum spouse or common-law partner amount of $13,808:
    (100 days in Canada ÷ 365 days in 2021) × $13,808 = $3,783.01

2.  Subtract spouse's or common-law partner's net income:
    $3,783.01 – $800.00 = $2,983.01

Suzanne claims $2,983.01 on line 30300 of her return.

Federal foreign tax credits

After you become a resident of Canada, you may receive income from the
country or region where you used to live or from another country or
region. This income may be subject to tax in Canada and the other
country or region. This could happen if:

-   no tax treaty exists between Canada and the other country or region
-   there is no provision in the tax treaty that prevents Canada and the
    other country or region from taxing the type of income you received

If this is your situation, you may be able to reduce the amount of
federal tax you have to pay in Canada by claiming a federal foreign tax
credit for the foreign tax that you paid. For information about federal
foreign tax credits, see Form T2209, Federal Foreign Tax Credits.

Your province or territory of residence may offer a similar credit. For
more information, see the tax package for the province or territory
where you resided on December 31, 2021. If you were a resident of
Quebec, see Revenu Quebec's Guide to the Income Tax Return.

Provincial or territorial tax and credits 

In the year that you immigrated, you usually have to pay tax to the
province or territory where you lived on December 31, 2021.

If you lived in Quebec on December 31, 2021, you can get information
about filing a Revenu Québec Income Tax Return and calculating your
provincial tax by contacting Revenu Québec.

If you resided in another province or territory on
December 31, 2021, see the tax package for the province or territory
where you resided for information about how to calculate your provincial
or territorial tax using Form 428.

Provincial or territorial non-refundable tax credits

Similar to the amount of federal non-refundable tax credits you can
claim, as an immigrant, you may be limited in the amount you can claim
in 2021 for certain provincial or territorial non-refundable tax
credits.

Generally, the rules for calculating your provincial or territorial
non-refundable tax credits are the same as the rules for calculating
your corresponding federal non-refundable tax credits. However, the
amounts used to calculate most provincial or territorial non-refundable
tax credits are different from the corresponding federal credits.

Provincial or territorial tax credits

Certain provinces and territories offer tax credits. For information on
these credits and how to claim them, see the tax package for the
province or territory where you resided on December 31, 2021.

Tax treaties

Canada has income tax conventions or agreements (commonly referred to as
tax treaties) with the countries and regions listed below. These tax
treaties are designed to avoid double taxation for those who would
otherwise have to pay tax in Canada and another country or region on the
same income. Generally, tax treaties determine how much each country or
region can tax your income.

To get the status and text of Canada's tax treaties, go to Tax treaties.
